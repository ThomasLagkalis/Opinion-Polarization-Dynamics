This project reproduces the key results from the paper **"Dynamics of Opinion Polarization"** by *Elisabetta Biondi, Claudio Castellano, and Lucilla de Arcangelis*. The original paper investigates how opinions evolve and polarize in a network of interacting agents. This repository contains a Python implementation of the proposed model, simulation results, and analysis. The code is in a notebook format and contains all the results usedin [presentation slides](). If you want a more in depth analysis of the code feel free to check the [code report]().
